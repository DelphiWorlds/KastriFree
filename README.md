# KastriFree

From [Delphi Worlds](http://www.delphiworlds.com)

## Attention 

**Kastri Free has been retired permanently.**

For ongoing development, please refer to the [new Kastri repo](https://github.com/DelphiWorlds/Kastri). If you would like to see something that was implemented in KastriFree in the Kastri repository, please [file an issue there](https://github.com/DelphiWorlds/Kastri/issues).

Kastri Free:

* Is a cross-platform library which builds upon the existing RTL and FMX libraries in Delphi
* Supports a number of newer APIs that you won't find in FMX/RTL, and "backfills" for missing APIs
* Is structured in a way so as to avoid creating unnecessary dependencies
* Follows strict coding standards to ensure consistency and readability
* Is kept as simple as practicable
* Is named after the [place in Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kastri,_Phocis) where [Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi) once stood
  
You'll find demo applications in the Demos folder, including those associated with articles posted on the [Delphi Worlds blog](http://www.delphiworlds.com/blog)
